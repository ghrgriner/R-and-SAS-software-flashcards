# Overview

This small repository contains the [text contents](ds_sassoftware_statprog_bios_comb.txt)
of a flashcard deck for reviewing statistical programming in both the R and SAS
programming languages / statistical environments. The R content is incomplete in the sense
that I have shared some notes on selected advanced topics only [in another deck](https://github.com/ghrgriner/advanced-R-flashcards) under a different license. This other deck is omitted
from further discussion here.

The R notes cover both base R and 'tidyverse' programming [2], but the graphics
discussion is pretty limited. The notes on the SAS language cover base SAS,
macro programming, selected SAS/STAT procedures, and the output delivery system (ODS).

A version of the deck for use in the Anki flashcard program is also shared
[on AnkiWeb here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/742287929). There is a
24-hour delay on AnkiWeb between the time a deck is submitted for sharing and
the time it is visible to the public. Therefore, if the above link is
inaccessible, check back in 24 hours. I intend to only perform updates to the
deck on that website over the weekend.

The fields are documented at the link on AnkiWeb above or in the wiki of this
repository. The wiki will often be more up-to-date, as I usually only update
the AnkiWeb documentation when the deck is changed (because of the downtime
that causes).
